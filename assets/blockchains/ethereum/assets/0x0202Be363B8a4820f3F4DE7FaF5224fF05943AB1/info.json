    "description": "UniLend is a permission-less decentralized protocol that combines spot trading services and money markets with lending and borrowing services through smart contracts. Existing DeFi platforms act as a gatekeeper, thereby barring the majority of assets from participation. Multi-asset pools also expose lenders to risk associated with all of the included assets.",
