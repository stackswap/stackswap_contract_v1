    "description": "SIREN is a distributed protocol for creating, trading, and redeeming fully-collateralized options contracts for any ERC-20 token on Ethereum. Options are a financial primitive from which one can build many different more complex financial instruments. At their core, options give a trader the choice to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price at a known time in the future. This is useful for protecting one's self (a.k.a hedging) against possible price changes in the asset, as well as speculating on these price changes. SIREN options are written and traded using an Automated Market Maker (AMM) specifically designed for options, and the SIREN governance token plays a role in coordinating the options markets.",
